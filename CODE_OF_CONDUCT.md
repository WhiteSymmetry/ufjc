# Code of Conduct

Inspired by [the Sandia values](https://hr.sandia.gov/career/performance-management/sandia-values/), contributors are required to do the following:

- **Respect each other.** Criticize ideas, not people.
- **Act with integrity.** Trust is a fragile thing.
- **Deliver with excellence.** Standards for code performance, style, and testing are high.
- **Team up for great results.** Do not be afraid to ask for help.

By following this code of conduct, contributors can help **serve the nation.**
